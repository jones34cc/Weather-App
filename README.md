# üå¶Ô∏è Weather-App

Find the weather of any place supported by the integrated Weather API.


## Tech Stack

**Backend:**

- Node.js
- Express.js (^4.21.2)
- Body-parser (^1.20.3)

**Frontend:**

- HTML
- JavaScript



## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Weather-App.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Weather-App
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Dependencies

Key dependencies include:

- **Express.js:**  Provides a robust web framework for handling routing and requests.
- **Body-parser:** Parses incoming request bodies (e.g., form data) in a middleware before your handlers, available under the `req.body` property.


## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or a port specified by your server configuration).

3. Make requests to API endpoints (you will need to define these in your `server.js` based on how you want to handle requests and interact with the weather API).

   **Example (assuming a `/weather` endpoint):**

   ```bash
   # Get weather for London
   curl http://localhost:3000/weather?city=London 

   # Get weather using coordinates (latitude and longitude)
   curl http://localhost:3000/weather?lat=51.5074&lon=0.1278
   ```

   The server will then fetch weather data from the integrated weather API and return the results.


## Features

- **Weather API Integration:** Retrieve real-time weather data for various locations. 
- **Data Parsing:** Parse and format weather data for display.
